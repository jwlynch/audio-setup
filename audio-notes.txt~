<SerajewelKS> jim: i literally run "pulseaudio --kill" then hit "start"
                   in qjackctl, then run "pulseaudio --start", run my
		   script to create the bridges, then start ardour

<alkisg> jim, does this work? systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.socket;
              start jack; systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.service
<alkisg> sorry, both of them, THEN start jack, then restart services

<jim> alkisg, should I restart the socket and the service in the reverse order
              I stop them in?
<alkisg> Sure

to make sure memory can be allocated by audio group members, set ulimit -l to unlimited, and also make
sure to log out and log back in to make sure user's membership in audio group is active

<jim> hi... how can I tell which alsa sink my pulseaudio is sending to, in order to get to the speakers?
<jim> I want to try to get jackd to send to that same sink
<wabbits> jim `pactl list sinks` search for the alsa.mixer_name key/val
<wabbits> that will give you the mapping between the alsa playback device and the
            corresponding pulseaudio sink
<wabbits> another way would be to use your ears :|
<jim> alsa.mixer_name = "Intel Haswell HDMI"
<wabbits> use `aplay -l` to find out what cards you have and then `alsamixer -c$card` to see
            the matching name
