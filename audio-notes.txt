<SerajewelKS> jim: i literally run "pulseaudio --kill" then hit "start"
                   in qjackctl, then run "pulseaudio --start", run my
		   script to create the bridges, then start ardour

<alkisg> jim, does this work? systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.socket;
              start jack; systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.service
<alkisg> sorry, both of them, THEN start jack, then restart services
<jim> alkisg, should I restart the socket and the service in the reverse order
              I stop them in?
<alkisg> Sure

to make sure memory can be allocated by audio group members, set ulimit -l to
unlimited, and also make sure to log out and log back in to make sure user's
membership in audio group is active

<jim> hi... how can I tell which alsa sink my pulseaudio is sending to,
        in order to get to the speakers?
<jim> I want to try to get jackd to send to that same sink
<wabbits> jim `pactl list sinks` search for the alsa.mixer_name key/val
<wabbits> that will give you the mapping between the alsa playback device and the
            corresponding pulseaudio sink
<wabbits> another way would be to use your ears :|
<jim> alsa.mixer_name = "Intel Haswell HDMI"
<wabbits> use `aplay -l` to find out what cards you have and then
            `alsamixer -c$card` to see the matching name

<SerajewelKS> do you still have the line i use to create more
                pulseaudio -> jack sinks?
<SerajewelKS> in case you want to be able to separate audio from your
                programs; you can direct the audio with pavucontrol
<jim> no, I'd appreciate a repost... and, 
<jim> what's the difference between how it is now (I guess one sink?) and multiple?
<SerajewelKS> pactl load-module module-jack-sink client_name=pulse_sink_"$1"
                connect=no channels=2
<SerajewelKS> "$1" obviously is the script argument, if you put it in a script
<jim> so each sink is stereo?
<SerajewelKS> each sink adds two things: the sink in pulseaudio (of course)
                and a corresponding source in jack
<SerajewelKS> yes
<SerajewelKS> if you direct the output of two programs to one sink, pulseaudio
                mixes them together and sends the result to jack, so in
		the jack world the audio is already mixed together
<jim> it loads another copy of the module?
<jim> each time that is
<SerajewelKS> i'm not sure if that's what happens under the hood, but either
                way you get another sink
<SerajewelKS> then on the jack side, each pulseaudio sink can be read separately
<SerajewelKS> i use this so i can apply dynamic range compression to twitch,
                but not to my other audio
<SerajewelKS> and eq my music, but not my other audio
<SerajewelKS> so i have a "twitch" sink and a "music" sink (and a few others)
<jim> so that module load also adds a corresponding source to jack?
<SerajewelKS> correct
<SerajewelKS> i refer to them as "bridges"
<SerajewelKS> a sink in one system that passes audio to a source in another system
<SerajewelKS> each bridge is a separate audio path
<SerajewelKS> i also use this type of setup on windows (though with
                something else instead of pulse... i still use jack and ardour)
<SerajewelKS> sometimes i stream on twitch, and i want a different mix in
                my headphones than i send to the stream
<SerajewelKS> i can do that because i separate the audio from various programs.
                not every program, but most.
<SerajewelKS> my music player goes in one channel, my mic in one, my game
                in another, the "default" one (for system sounds) in another
		which i can mute for the stream mix
<SerajewelKS> can gate+eq+compress my mic

<jim> right now I gotta get a simple small (maybe POS) mic I can use to get
        vocal audio (legable hopefully :) to a track, on ardour, audacity
	or something
<SerajewelKS> one neat thing you can use bridges for is to record audio from a
                specific program, without having to worry about other programs
		making noise while you record
<jim> and I figure a simple analog headset with a mic could fit that bill
<SerajewelKS> of course, pulse can already do that by recording from a monitor device
<SerajewelKS> but when i have pulse+jack set up it's just easier to do that using jack
<SerajewelKS> yep, i have one such headset for when i game/stream
<SerajewelKS> the ardour setup is nice because i can apply all that cleaning
                up to my mic even for just voice chat with others, not even
		streaming to twitch
<jim> how has your headset lasted?
<SerajewelKS> so my teammates don't have to put up with background noise and
                large dynamic range
<SerajewelKS> it's alright.  the mic is kinda crappy but it's not like i didn't
                expect that.
<SerajewelKS> of course it's hard to tell how much of the noise is just line
                noise in the sound card
<jim> how long have you had it?
<SerajewelKS> not sure, let me check my music history
<SerajewelKS> it has a wind screen, which is nice
<jim> that would be nice for the puh lce audio and puh inging a host that might
        need puh inging
<jim> when you find when you got it, could you let me know which one it is?
<SerajewelKS> "puh"?
<jim> the wind screen would filter that out
<SerajewelKS> ah, i just didn't understand what you meant :)
<SerajewelKS> https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KX3TLF4/
<SerajewelKS> i got it in december 2015
<SerajewelKS> still going strong, though my usage hasn't been what i would call heavy
<SerajewelKS> i used to use it at least once a week to game with friends
<SerajewelKS> now i mostly use it 1-2 times a month for work conference calls :)
<SerajewelKS> i used it a lot for gaming because my office was right next to the
                living room.  now my office is in the basement so i don't feel
		the need to keep it that quiet.
<jim> call that beginning of 2016,,, so a bit over 3.5 years
<SerajewelKS> yeah
<jim> and it never developed problems?
<SerajewelKS> hasn't yet
<SerajewelKS> i got my sony mdr7506 headphones that i use at work in july 2015
<SerajewelKS> i had to replace the pads today because they were starting to tear
<SerajewelKS> but they get a lot more use, so it's probably not a fair comparison
<jim> lotsa gaming with it?
<SerajewelKS> the sonys?  nah, i have them at work.  i use them to listen to
                music and try to block out background noise.  :)
<SerajewelKS> my company does the tech for some live streaming events (video
                mixing and streaming equipment; usually there's a separate
		company doing the audio)
<SerajewelKS> and i usually bring the sonys to those events as well so i can
                monitor the internet feed
<SerajewelKS> they aren't a headset though (no mic)
<SerajewelKS> but the audio quality is incredible
<SerajewelKS> i figured if i'm listening to music at work every day i can
                justify an $80 set of headphones
<jim> but the sony doesn't have a mic?
<SerajewelKS> correct
<SerajewelKS> they're marketed as studio monitors
<jim> ok
<SerajewelKS> e.g. to be used in an audio production studio
<SerajewelKS> but my dad has a set for personal use and i used them a lot growing
                up.  really liked them, so i figured why not
<SerajewelKS> i think he's had the same pair for like 15+ years
<SerajewelKS> anyway
<jim> your dad has the sonys too?
<SerajewelKS> the hyperx headset is definity decent and it seems to have lasted
                awhile.  the mic is also a detachable piece so you can pull it
		off if you want to use them as headphones for a bit without
		having a mic in your face.
<SerajewelKS> yeah he also has the mdr7506 set
<SerajewelKS> they're used by a lot of audio professionals
